Siri - AI by Apple that communicates verbally with users 

Siri is a chatbot AI developed by Apple Inc. that supports Apple devices like iPhones, iPads, Macs and HomePods, among others. It was first made public in 2011 and is now one of the best known virtual assistant in the market.

Siri was created to help facilitate user access to multiple services, information and tasks through voices. This means that the interaction among users and Siri takes place through natural language questions and commands. Natural language processing and machine learning algorithms are used by Siri in understanding and replying to user’s questions.

In that case, Siri disturbs the market status quo. The voice-controlled interface, as a first, changes the manner in which users communicate with their devices. Rather than rely on touching and typing, users can talk to their devices to get them to fetch information for them using Siri. This is a convenient way of interacting without having to hold anything since it is ideal for multitasking and when users are immobile.

Additionally, Siri works together with several apps and services such that users are able to interact with only one system. Siri will enable users to send text messages, call, set reminders and appointments, play music, navigate maps and many others jobs. Siri helps in controlling devices by reducing switching between multiple apps and thus makes it easier to use.

Siri also disrupts by understanding context and giving tailored answers. Thus, siri gets better and better as time goes. The customization of Siri makes it friendlier to users making it more relevant, functional and usable.

Also, Siri has created opportunities for app and service creators to integrate their products with the virtual assistant. Apple presents SiriKit which is a framework through which developers develop specific Siri enabled functions within their applications. Siri’s capabilities are extended to other domains and it becomes more integrated at this level.

Therefore, Siri disturbs the general market by launching a voice controlled interface, integrating different services, giving custom answers, and allowing third party integration. It has completely altered the way people handle these devices, leading the way to virtual assistant domination of the market. Siri’s consistent progressions and betterments expand the capabilities of an AI chatbot towards user interactions and usefulness.
