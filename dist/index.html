Personal computers and cell phones are disruptive technologies that cause significant changes in people's lives. They have revolutionized our study, work, and free time. The demand for computers and cell phones reduced the use of typewriters and telephones and brought significant changes to the market.</p>

             <p>Clayton Christensen, a business consultant and Harvard Business School professor, first introduced the term disrupted technology as "disruptive innovation" in a 1995 article in Harvard Business Review. Disruptive innovation, coined by Christensen, is a technology that suddenly alters how industries, companies, and consumers operate. It resembles the Fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and emerging technological advances, according to Repsol.com.</p>

             <p>Davenport et al. (2021) state that Artificial Intelligence (AI) can significantly enhance marketing by improving customer understanding, product matching, and persuasion. Numerous companies have started utilizing AI to manage specific tasks, such as programmatic buying for digital ad placement. It also assists in broad functions like improving the accuracy of sales forecasts and enhances human efforts in structured tasks like customer service.</p>

This is a personalized interactive online communication, focused on mental health support for people. Vivabot employs artificial intelligence together with the natural language processing in order to discuss with users the psychotherapy dialogues and give information about the mental wellness issues.</p>
            <p>Vivibot has its origin in the widespread demand for affordable and easy-to-access mental health care.

 <h4><strong>Woebot - Mental health bot available an app</strong></h4>   
            <p>Woebot is a conversational AI chatbot for providing mental health support to people. Woobot Health developed it with a view of making mental health resources accessible and personalized.</p>
            <p>Woebot’s origin lies in the desire for scalable and affordable mental health products. Due to scarceness, high cost and stigma there might be problems in traditional mental healthcare.

         <section id="Siri"</section>
<h4><strong>Siri - AI by Apple that communicates verbally with users</strong></h4>
            <p>Siri is a chatbot AI developed by Apple Inc. that supports Apple devices like iPhones, iPads, Macs and HomePods, among others. It was first made public in 2011 and is now one of the best known virtual assistant in the market.</p>
            <p>Siri was created to help facilitate user access to multiple services, information and tasks through voices. This means that the interaction among users and Siri takes place through natural language questions and commands. Natural language processing and machine learning algorithms are used by Siri in understanding and replying to user’s questions.</p>
            <p>In that case, Siri disturbs the market status quo. The voice-controlled interface, as a first, changes the manner in which users communicate with their devices. Rather than rely on touching and typing, users can talk to their devices to get them to fetch information for them using Siri. This is a convenient way of interacting without having to hold anything since it is ideal for multitasking and when users are immobile.</p>
            <p>Additionally, Siri works together with several apps and services such that users are able to interact with only one system. Siri will enable users to send text messages, call, set reminders and appointments, play music, navigate maps and many others jobs. Siri helps in controlling devices by reducing switching between multiple apps and thus makes it easier to use.</p>
            <p>Siri also disrupts by understanding context and giving tailored answers. Thus, siri gets better and better as time goes. The customization of Siri makes it friendlier to users making it more relevant, functional and usable.</p>
            <p>Also, Siri has created opportunities for app and service creators to integrate their products with the virtual assistant. Apple presents SiriKit which is a framework through which developers develop specific Siri enabled functions within their applications. Siri’s capabilities are extended to other domains and it becomes more integrated at this level.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Siri disturbs the general market by launching a voice controlled interface, integrating different services, giving custom answers, and allowing third party integration. It has completely altered the way people handle these devices, leading the way to virtual assistant domination of the market. Siri’s consistent progressions and betterments expand the capabilities of an AI chatbot towards user interactions and usefulness.</p>
  
        <section id="Roo"</section>
<h4><strong>Roo - sexual health educational bot</strong></h4>
        <p>Roo is a sexual education chatbot made by Planned Parenthood for teenagers to discuss their sexually intimate curiosities, relationships, and physical health without the need to talk to a human being. The chatbot provides safety and anonymity by not collecting cookies from its users (Carey, 2020).</p>
        <p>Since its launch in 2019, it has recorded over 3.5 million chats, and 78% of its users are ages 13 to 19. Teenage users became comfortable using the chatbot because of its visual identity and personalized tone, which aims to be gender-neutral and playful yet mature. It collected accurate sexual health information through a 6-month machine learning from various medical resources before its official launch (Work & Co, 2023).</p>
        <p>As the chatbot becomes accessible and safe for teenage users,  it challenges the traditional approach to sexual education in school departments. Teenage users would not have to open their questions to either their teachers or their peers about their sexual curiosity and would go straight to the chatbot instead.</p>
        <p>For other communities who do not have access to sexual education, it imposes a risk of relying too much on the chatbot and the Internet about their sexual curiosities. Fortunately, Roo provides additional medical and scientific resources such as articles and videos to their answer or redirects them to a live person when the chatbot cannot answer the user's question (Carey, 2020).</p>
        <p>Overall, while Roo eases the comfort of teenage users with sexual education and awareness, it disrupts the social interaction and livelihoods of teachers and advisers who focus on sexual education.</p>
  
          <section id="Replika"</section>
 <h4><strong>Replika - The AI that understands you</strong></h4>   
        <p>Replika is an AI chatbot that utilizes textual context to procure personal conversations. The AI analyzes the text messages’ mannerisms, style, and topics to replicate how the person will write or talk to reply. Many say that Replika is like mirroring the person.</p>
        <p>Replika gained immense popularity because people were finding emotional and casual conversations with this chatbot. With the help of the co-founder of Luka, Philip, they built a build-your-own AI companion called Replika. You can customize Replika's avatar and earn points to buy more accessories and add personalities. They also offer the AI’s ”diary” to review past interactions. </p>
        <p>Replika's main feature is making a safe space to converse with yourself. All the AI needs is the person’s conversation with it. After chatting with the bot for a while,  the AI can hold topics and words that the person wants to hear.</p>
        <p>Replika disturbs the therapeutic market because users are comfortable sharing their inner feelings with the bot. Replika is free and offers pro versions that have more in-depth and dynamic conversations, such as roleplaying and video calls, with advanced AI.</p>
